# 🎵 Spotify Hybrid Recommender System
## 📌 Overview
This project builds a personalized music recommender system that combines:

1. Spotify API Data – real data from a user’s account (liked songs, playlists, top artists, metadata).

2. Kaggle Dataset – large-scale dataset with audio features for training ML models.

The goal is to create a hybrid recommendation engine powered by both:

 1. Spotify API + Metadata Filtering (genres, popularity, related artists).
 2. Machine Learning Models trained on Kaggle data to predict track likability.

The final product is a Streamlit web app where users can:

    ✅ View their Spotify profile, playlists, top tracks.

    ✅ Get recommendations by genre, similar artists, or Spotify’s own API.

    ✅ Try an ML-powered mix where models re-rank songs by predicted likability.

    ✅ Save recommended songs into new Spotify playlists.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
1. Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

2. Spotipy (Spotify Web API client)

3. Streamlit (interactive UI)

4. Kaggle Dataset (for ML training)

5. Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest,Gradient Boosting
