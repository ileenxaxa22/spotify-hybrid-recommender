# spotify-hybrid-recommender
Hybrid Spotify recommender system using Spotify API data + Kaggle dataset, with ML models and Streamlit app.
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project builds a personalized music recommender system that combines:

Spotify API Data â€“ real data from a userâ€™s account (liked songs, playlists, top artists, metadata).

Kaggle Dataset â€“ large-scale dataset with audio features for training ML models.

The goal is to create a hybrid recommendation engine powered by both:

Spotify API + Metadata Filtering (genres, popularity, related artists).

Machine Learning Models trained on Kaggle data to predict track likability.

The final product is a Streamlit web app where users can:
âœ… View their Spotify profile, playlists, top tracks.
âœ… Get recommendations by genre, similar artists, or Spotifyâ€™s own API.
âœ… Try an ML-powered mix where models re-rank songs by predicted likability.
âœ… Save recommended songs into new Spotify playlists.
